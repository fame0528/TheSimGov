# FID-20251205-010: Core Industry Tick Processors

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** P0 (Core Gameplay)  
**Complexity:** 4 (Complex)  
**Estimated:** 16-24h  
**Actual:** 8h  
**Created:** 2025-12-05  
**Completed:** 2025-12-05  
**Depends On:** FID-20251205-009 (Banking Foundation - ✅ COMPLETE)

---

## Summary

Build tick processors for the three most critical industries after Banking:
1. **Empire** - Synergy calculations, resource flows, bonuses ✅
2. **Energy** - Power generation, PPA fulfillment, grid billing ✅
3. **Manufacturing** - Production runs, material consumption, orders ✅

These processors plug into the Game Tick Engine (already built) and enable time-based gameplay for core industries.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Empire tick processor calculates active synergies based on owned companies
- [x] Empire tick processor applies resource flow bonuses between companies
- [x] Energy tick processor calculates power generation per facility type
- [x] Energy tick processor processes PPA contracts and spot sales
- [x] Manufacturing tick processor runs production cycles
- [x] Manufacturing tick processor consumes raw materials from inventory
- [x] All processors integrate with existing TickEngine.registerProcessor()
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors

## Implementation Results

### Phase 1: Empire Tick Processor ✅
- Created `empireProcessor.ts` (450 LOC)
- Processes synergies from PlayerEmpire.activeSynergies
- Calculates resource flows between owned companies
- Grants empire XP based on activity
- Returns EmpireTickSummary

### Phase 2: Energy Tick Processor ✅
- Created `energyProcessor.ts` (550 LOC)
- Processes OilWells, SolarFarms, WindTurbines, GasFields, PowerPlants
- Calculates generation with seasonal/weather factors
- Fulfills PPAs with contracted pricing
- Sells excess on spot market
- Tracks commodity production (oil, gas, electricity)

### Phase 3: Manufacturing Tick Processor ✅
- Created `manufacturingProcessor.ts` (500 LOC)
- Processes ManufacturingFacility OEE and utilization
- Advances ProductionLine batch progress
- Calculates throughput and defect rates
- Processes Supplier orders and deliveries
- Returns ManufacturingTickSummary

### Phase 4: Integration ✅
- Updated tick/index.ts with all exports
- Registered all processors in tickEngine DEFAULT_CONFIG
- Added EnergyTickSummary and ManufacturingTickSummary types
- TypeScript: 0 errors

## Notes

- Empire processor is highest priority (enables synergies)
- Energy and Manufacturing are the two most infrastructure-heavy industries
- Other industries (Retail, Tech, Media, etc.) follow in FID-20251205-011
