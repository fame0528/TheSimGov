## Description
Implement a sector-based company system where companies own, expand, and compete for sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Media, Tech) in different states. Sectors generate revenue, can be expanded or downsized, and are affected by marketing, unionization, and events. Includes dashboards, financials, leaderboards, and strategic actions.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Companies can own multiple sectors with location, type, growth, revenue, profit, market share, unionization, and upgrades.
- Players can expand, downsize, invest in marketing, attack/defend, and negotiate with unions.
- Sectors generate revenue and profit per turn, affected by growth and events.
- UI dashboards show all sector stats, actions, and financials.
- Leaderboards and achievements track top companies/sectors.
- Tutorial/help panel explains mechanics.
- All code meets ECHO AAA standards, DRY, and documentation requirements.

---

## Approach
- Define sector/company data models and database schema.
- Build backend API for sector actions and turn progression.
- Create React components for dashboards, actions, and financials.
- Implement turn engine and event system.
- Add tutorial/help panel and achievements.
- Follow utility-first, pattern discovery, and legacy analysis protocols.
