# FID-20251205-012: Specialty Industry Tick Processors

**Status:** PLANNED  
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)  
**Complexity:** 3 (Medium)  
**Estimated:** 12-16h  
**Created:** 2025-12-05  
**Depends On:** FID-20251205-011 (Revenue Industry Tick Processors)

---

## Summary

Build tick processors for specialty industries:
1. **Healthcare** - R&D progress, clinical trials, patient services
2. **Crime** - Price fluctuations, heat decay, facility production
3. **Politics** - Bill progress, election cycles, lobbying effects

These add depth and variety to gameplay.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Healthcare tick processor advances research projects
- [ ] Healthcare tick processor processes clinical trial phases
- [ ] Healthcare tick processor generates patient service revenue
- [ ] Crime tick processor fluctuates state pricing
- [ ] Crime tick processor decays heat levels over time
- [ ] Crime tick processor processes production facility output
- [ ] Politics tick processor advances bills through chambers
- [ ] Politics tick processor processes lobbying action effects
- [ ] All processors integrate with TickEngine
- [ ] TypeScript: 0 errors

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Healthcare Processor (5h)
```typescript
// src/lib/game/tick/healthcareProcessor.ts
- Advance ResearchProject progress
- Process clinical trial phases (I, II, III, IV)
- Generate revenue from Clinic/Hospital visits
- Handle drug/device approval events
- Calculate R&D costs
- Return HealthcareTickSummary
```

### Phase 2: Crime Processor (5h)
```typescript
// src/lib/game/tick/crimeProcessor.ts
- Update StatePricing with random fluctuations
- Apply supply/demand effects from player activity
- Decay HeatLevel over time (natural cooling)
- Process ProductionFacility yields
- Handle gang territory income
- Return CrimeTickSummary
```

### Phase 3: Politics Processor (4h)
```typescript
// src/lib/game/tick/politicsProcessor.ts
- Advance Bill through legislative process
- Process lobbying action effectiveness
- Update politician approval ratings
- Handle election cycle events
- Calculate political contribution effects
- Return PoliticsTickSummary
```

### Phase 4: Integration (2h)
- Register processors
- Update API
- Testing
