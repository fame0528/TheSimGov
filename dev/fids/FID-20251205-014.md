## Next Steps: Implementation FIDs (from Master Plan)

**Total Estimated Implementation Work: ~100 hours**

| Phase | Description | Hours | Priority | FID |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------|-----|
| A | Core Loop UI (Treasury Bar, Notifications, Revenue Ticker) | 16h | P0 | TBD |
| B | Logistics Industry (Complete 15th industry) | 16h | P0 | FID-20251205-013 |
| C | Tick Scheduler + Offline Progress | 8h | P0 | TBD |
| D | Synergy Wiring (Apply bonuses to production) | 12h | P0 | TBD |
| E | Player Progression UI (Achievements, Levels, XP) | 12h | P0 | TBD |
| F | Tutorial & Onboarding | 16h | P0 | TBD |
