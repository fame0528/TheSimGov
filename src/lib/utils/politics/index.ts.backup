/**
 * @fileoverview Barrel exports for politics utilities (baseline influence & lobbying).
 * @created 2025-11-25
 * @updated 2025-11-26 - Added Phase 1 FID-001B utilities (Campaign Engine & Scheduler)
+ * 
+ * NOTE: campaignEngine.ts and campaignPhase.ts are DIFFERENT models:
+ * - campaignEngine: 4-phase simplified FSM (ANNOUNCEMENT → FUNDRAISING → ACTIVE → RESOLUTION)
+ * - campaignPhase: 7-phase detailed cycle (FUNDRAISING → LOBBYING → PR → DEBATE_PREP → DEBATE → POST_DEBATE → ELECTION)
+ * Both export PHASE_DURATIONS, hence using explicit re-exports to avoid ambiguity.
