# Crime Domain Alpha Scaffold – Completion Report

Date: 2025-11-30
Status: Alpha scaffold complete; TypeScript 0 errors

## Summary
- Implemented Crime Alpha pages and hooks with ethical safeguards.
- Contracts-first validations (Zod) enforce real substance catalog and inputs.
- Added DisclaimerGate; all pages gated accordingly.
- All TypeScript checks pass (`npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`).

## Files Created/Modified
- Pages:
  - `src/app/game/crime/laundering/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/game/crime/heat/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/game/crime/page.tsx` (navigation updated)
- Hooks:
  - `src/lib/hooks/useCrime.ts` (updated `useHeat` signature, expose `mutate`)
- Validations:
  - `src/lib/validations/crime.ts` (fixed dynamic `z.enum` for `substance`)

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- Real substances only; manufacturing abstracted (no synthesis guidance).
- Age/disclaimer gate enforced across Crime pages.
- API contracts validated via Zod; UI consumes endpoints via SWR hooks.
- TypeScript verification at 0 errors.

## Next Recommendations
- Add adapters for typed mapping from API envelopes to UI models.
- Implement backend models/controllers when moving beyond placeholders.
- Expand tests for validations and hooks.
