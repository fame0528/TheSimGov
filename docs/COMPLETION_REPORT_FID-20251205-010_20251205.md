Priority 30: Energy     - Power generation (NEW)
Priority 40: Manufacturing - Production (NEW)
```

## Architecture Notes

1. **ITickProcessor Interface**: All processors implement the same interface with:
   - `name`: Unique identifier
   - `priority`: Execution order (lower = first)
   - `process()`: Main tick handler
   - `enabled`: Toggle on/off

2. **Seasonal Factors**: Energy processor includes seasonal modifiers:
   - Solar: 0.7 (winter) to 1.2 (summer)
   - Wind: 1.2 (winter) to 0.8 (summer)

3. **OEE Calculation**: Manufacturing uses industry-standard formula:
   - OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality
   - Each component tracked separately

4. **Error Recovery**: All processors use continueOnError pattern - individual entity failures don't stop the tick.

## Next Steps

**FID-20251205-011: Revenue Industry Tick Processors**
- Retail (sales, inventory, foot traffic)
- Tech (SaaS subscriptions, hosting, data)
- Media (content, advertising, streaming)
- Consulting (contracts, billable hours)
