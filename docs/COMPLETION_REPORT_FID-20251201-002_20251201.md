# Completion Report — FID-20251201-002 (ECHO Compliance Phase 1)

**Date:** 2025-12-01  
**Status:** COMPLETE (Phase 1 batch)  
**Scope:** Envelope standardization + type safety at API boundaries for selected endpoints

## Summary
- Migrated four high-traffic endpoints to standardized success/error envelopes.
- Preserved HTTP semantics (201 Created on POST) via enhanced `createSuccessResponse<T>(..., status?)` helper.
- Tightened boundary types and removed unsafe patterns in route handlers.
- Verified TypeScript compile (strict) and ran full Jest suite — no regressions.

## Files Updated
- `src/app/api/manufacturing/facilities/route.ts` — GET/POST envelope migration
- `src/app/api/employees/[id]/route.ts` — GET/PATCH/DELETE envelope migration
- `src/app/api/ai/marketplace/models/route.ts` — GET/POST/PATCH envelope migration; safer ownership typing
- `src/app/api/politics/campaigns/route.ts` — GET/POST envelope migration
- `src/lib/utils/apiResponse.ts` — `createSuccessResponse<T>(data, meta?, status=200)` adds optional status

## Verification
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors
- Jest: 33/33 suites, 440/440 tests passed
- Logs: Expected ECHO info/debug entries; leaderboard aggregation gracefully handled no DB connection in error path

## Acceptance Criteria
- Standard response envelopes across targeted endpoints — Achieved
- Type safety at API boundaries without `as any` — Achieved (boundary level)
- Status code preservation for non-200 success (201) — Achieved
- Compile + tests clean — Achieved

## Notes & Recommendations
- Phase 2 candidates: `manufacturing/orders`, `business/transactions`, `ai/marketplace/purchases` (if present), plus any remaining endpoints using direct `NextResponse.json(...)`.
- Broaden unsafe-cast sweep beyond API boundaries (DTOs/adapters/services).
- Continue ECHO audit remediation (TODO/FIXME triage; unify error detail structures).

## Metrics
- Endpoints migrated: 4
- Helper enhancements: 1
- TypeScript errors: 0
- Test suites: 33/33 passed
