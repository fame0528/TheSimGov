# Sector System Documentation

## Overview
The sector system enables companies to own, manage, and grow sectors unique to their industry and state. Sectors are strictly typed, support upgrades, events, and financial tracking, and enforce AAA/ECHO compliance.

## Key Features
- Sector ownership restricted by company industry
- Sectors are unique per state
- Sector actions: expand, downsize, invest in marketing, trigger events, apply upgrades
- Event system: random and triggered events (strikes, booms, scandals, regulations, upgrades, takeovers, etc.)
- Financial tracking: revenue, profit, growth
- UI components: dashboard, card, help panel

## Sector Types
See `src/lib/types/sector.ts` for all sector types and allowed mappings.

## Constants
- Upgrade costs: `src/lib/utils/constants.sector.ts`
- Event probabilities: `src/lib/utils/constants.sector.ts`
- State uniqueness: enforced in model and engine

## API Endpoints
- `src/app/api/sectors/route.ts`: CRUD and event operations
- `src/app/api/sectors/[id]/route.ts`: GET, PATCH, DELETE by sector ID

## Model Integration
- Company model (`src/lib/db/models/Company.ts`) enforces sector ownership rules and uniqueness per state
- Sector model (`src/lib/db/models/Sector.ts`) supports all mechanics

## UI Components
- `src/components/sector/SectorDashboard.tsx`: Dashboard for all sectors
- `src/components/sector/SectorCard.tsx`: Card for individual sector
- `src/components/sector/index.ts`: Barrel export

## Utilities
- Sector engine: `src/lib/utils/sectorEngine.ts`
- Event system: `src/lib/utils/events.ts`

## Implementation Notes
- All code strictly typed, DRY, and AAA/ECHO compliant
- Documentation and constants centralized for maintainability
- Ready for future expansion and integration
