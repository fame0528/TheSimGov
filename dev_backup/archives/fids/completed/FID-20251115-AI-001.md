# FID-20251115-AI-001 — AI Research & Training System

Status: PLANNED  | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: 5/5  
Created: 2025-11-15 | Estimated: 4h

Summary:
End-to-end AI research workflow (projects, training jobs, compute clusters, model development) across AI L1–L5.

Acceptance:
- Research projects with budgets and datasets
- Training job queue with Compute Units
- Cloud/on-prem compute cluster management
- R&D Console UI (experiments + queue)
- Model lifecycle (size, params, deployment)
- Benchmarks (accuracy, perplexity, etc.)

Approach:
See dev/COMPANY_LEVEL_SYSTEM_SPEC.md and dev/BANKING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md (for funding flows).
