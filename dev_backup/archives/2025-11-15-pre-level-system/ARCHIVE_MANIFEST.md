# Archive Manifest — Pre-Level System Baseline

Date: 2025-11-15
Scope: dev/archives/2025-11-15-pre-level-system

Purpose
- Preserve any pre–Company Level System planning artifacts for historical reference.
- Provide a clear index of items moved into this archive and why.

Status
- Archived Items: None (directory scaffolded; no files moved yet)
- Next Action: As older pre-level versions are identified and moved, append entries below.

Archive Entries (append-only)
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <path-from-repo-root> — Reason: <short rationale>

Suggested Candidates (for future archiving)
- Prior iterations of `dev/planned.md` predating FID Index.
- Any obsolete specs superseded by:
  - `dev/COMPANY_LEVEL_SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
  - `dev/BANKING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
  - `dev/POLITICS_BUSINESS_INTEGRATION.md`
- Old outlines superseded by `dev/roadmap.md` Phase 1.5.

Retention & Naming
- Keep this manifest as the single source of truth for this archive folder.
- Use date-stamped sub-manifests if entry count exceeds ~200.

Notes
- This archive is part of the November 15 baseline reset introducing the 5-level Company Level System, Banking (NPC + player-owned), and Politics integration gates.
